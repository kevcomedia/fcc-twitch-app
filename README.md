# FCC Twitch App

Twitch app project for FCC.

## User stories:
- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).
